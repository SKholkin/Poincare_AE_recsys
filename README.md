# Hyperbolic Autoencoder for Recommendations in JAX

Repository contains JAX implementation of AE model, which incorporates input information via embedding into Hyperbolic space, providing better accuracy when applied to collaborative filtering recommender systems.

The idea is taken from [Hyperbolic autoencoders for recommender systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3412219) by E.Frolov et al. and [HyperbolicRecommenders](https://github.com/evfro/HyperbolicRecommenders) repo.
